/*
There are some restrictions when naming the variables. These restrictions are considerded everytime we name a variable.
1. Variable name must start with an alphabet.
2. Number and alphabet can be used while naming a variable.
3. No symbol other than underscore(_) is used since an underscore is also considered as an alphabet.
4. C is a case-sensitive language and thus different variables can be decraled using different case.
5. Name of a variable cannot be same as a keyword (They are some defined words having some purpose eg. int, for, static).
These are all the naming restrictions for variables and functions.
However there are some ways to write good and readable code.
One of which is using lower case letters for naming variables and upper case for constants.

main()
{

  char a, fg, df_sf, s23, _f;
  
}

// All these variables are following the rules stated above and hence are valid.

/*
