There are five types of operators in C, Arithmetic, Logical/Relational, Increment & Decrement, Bitwise and Assignment operators.
Here we will cover Arithmetic and Logical Operators.

  Arithmetic Operators: These are the operators which consists the properties of regular operations.
  These all are binary operators since each of them deal with two values or elements.
  There are 5 basic arithmetic operators:
  + : it returns sum of two numbers
  - : it returns difference between two numbers
  * : it returns multiplication of two numbers
  / : it returns division of two numbers
  % : it returns the reminder on dividing two integer type numbers

  // In the printf of Modulo Division, we are using %% but it will show only % in the output.
  // % alone will work fine as well but the compiler tries to match it to a operation and thus gives us a warning.
  // To avoid that, we use a escape sequeance by using %%

  /*
  Relational or Logical Operators: These are the operators used to compare the values of two operators.
  There are 6 logical operators:
  < : lesser than
  > : greater than
  <= : lesser or equal to
  >= : greater or equal to
  == : equal to
  != : not equal to
  The output of these signs will be in form of 0 or 1 which stands for false or true respectively.
