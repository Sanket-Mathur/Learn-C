    Switch statement is a block consisting various case statement blocks which are executed based on the value of integer passed.
    The syntax for writing a switch statement is:
    switch(variable)
    {
      case value1: statement
      case value2: statement
      :
      :
      default: default statement
    }
    The cases inside the switch statement compares the value given to them to the variable passed.
    In case the value in any case not equal to that of the variable, dafault statement is executed.
    break statement is usually added after all the cases to come out of the switch block when one of the case is executed.
    Not using the break statement will cause the execution of all the case statements after the one whose value is matched.
    Though it is totally upon you if you want to execute the statements depending on the position they hold inside the block.
