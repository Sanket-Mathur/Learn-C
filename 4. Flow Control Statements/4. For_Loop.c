    Loops are iteration statements.
    These keep on executing the statements in them unless the condition is false.
    The syntax for a for loop is:
    for(declaration; condition; upgradation)
    {
        statement
    }
    These are used whereever repeated execution of a code is required

    }
    
    /*
    But with iteration on code comes a great responsibility
    If the condition is not placed or thought about enough, can get you stuck in an infinite loop.
    e.g.
    for(;;)
    {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
    }
    Here I'm not adding any condition, which is the easiest way of defining an infinite loop.
    Go try it out if you want to but take care that it might hang your current window.
