  An if statement consists of some statements of a block of code which will be executed only if the condition is true.

  /*
  A shorter way of of writing if(a != 0) is to write if(a).
  It represents that if a is 0 the expression is false else if the a is non-zero it is consitered as true.
  Thus the code inside if(0) will never be executed while code inside if(3) i.e any non-zero number will always be executed.
  Another this to see here is that you don't need to add braces i.e {} if there exist only one statement.
